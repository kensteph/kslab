</table>
    <p><code class="directive">MultiviewsMatch</code> permits three different
    behaviors for <a href="mod_negotiation.html">mod_negotiation</a>'s
    Multiviews feature.  Multiviews allows a request for a file,
    <em>e.g.</em> <code>index.html</code>, to match any negotiated
    extensions following the base request, <em>e.g.</em>
    <code>index.html.en</code>, <code>index.html.fr</code>, or
    <code>index.html.gz</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>NegotiatedOnly</code> option provides that every extension
    following the base name must correlate to a recognized
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a></code> extension for content negotiation, <em>e.g.</em>
    Charset, Content-Type, Language, or Encoding.  This is the strictest
    implementation with the fewest unexpected side effects, and is the
    default behavior.</p>

    <p>To include extensions associated with Handlers and/or Filters,
    set the <code class="directive">MultiviewsMatch</code> directive to either
    <code>Handlers</code>, <code>Filters</code>, or both option keywords.
    If all other factors are equal, the smallest file will be served,
    <em>e.g.</em> in deciding between <code>index.html.cgi</code> of 500
    bytes and <code>index.html.pl</code> of 1000 bytes, the <code>.cgi</code>
    file would win in this example. Users of <code>.asis</code> files
    might prefer to use the Handler option, if <code>.asis</code> files are
    associated with the <code>asis-handler</code>.</p>

    <p>You may finally allow <code>Any</code> extensions to match, even if
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a></code> doesn't recognize the extension. This was the
    behavior in Apache 1.3, and can cause unpredictable results, such as
    serving .old or .bak files the webmaster never expected to be served.</p>

    <p>For example, the following configuration will allow handlers
    and filters to participate in Multviews, but will exclude unknown
    files:</p>

    <div class="example"><p><code>
      MultiviewsMatch Handlers Filters
    </code></p></div>

    <p><code class="directive">MultiviewsMatch</code> is not allowed in a

    <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</a></code>. This file sets
    the default list of mappings from filename extensions to content
    types. Most administrators use the provided
    <code>mime.types</code> file, which associates common filename
    extensions with IANA registered content types. The current list is
    maintained at <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html">http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html</a>.  This
    simplifies the <code>httpd.conf</code> file by providing the
    majority of media-type definitions, and may be overridden by
    <code class="directive"><a href="#addtype">AddType</a></code> directives as
    needed. You should not edit the <code>mime.types</code> file,
    because it may be replaced when you upgrade your server.</p>

    <p>The file contains lines in the format of the arguments to
    an <code class="directive"><a href="#addtype">AddType</a></code> directive:</p>

    <div class="example"><p><code>
      <var>MIME-type</var> [<var>extension</var>] ...
    </code></p></div>

    <p>The case of the extension does not matter. Blank lines, and lines
    beginning with a hash character (<code>#</code>) are ignored.</p>

    <div class="note">
      Please do <strong>not</strong> send requests to the Apache HTTP
      Server Project to add any new entries in the distributed
      <code>mime.types</code> file unless (1) they are already
      registered with IANA, and (2) they use widely accepted,
      non-conflicting filename extensions across platforms.
      <code>category/x-subtype</code> requests will be automatically
      rejected, as will any new two-letter extensions as they will
      likely conflict later with the already crowded language and
      character set namespace.

<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>This module determines the <a class="glossarylink" href="../glossary.html#mime-type" title="see glossary">MIME
    type</a> of files in the same way the Unix
    <code>file(1)</code> command works: it looks at the first few
    bytes of the file. It is intended as a "second line of defense"
    for cases that <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a></code> can't resolve.</p>

    <p>This module is derived from a free version of the
    <code>file(1)</code> command for Unix, which uses "magic
    numbers" and other hints from a file's contents to figure out
    what the contents are. This module is active only if the magic
    file is specified by the <code class="directive"><a href="#mimemagicfile">MimeMagicFile</a></code> directive.</p>

    <p>For example, the following magic file lines would recognize
    some audio formats:</p>

    <div class="example"><pre># Sun/NeXT audio data
0      string      .snd
&gt;12    belong      1       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong      2       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong      3       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong      4       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong      5       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong      6       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong      7       audio/basic
&gt;12    belong     23       audio/x-adpcm</pre></div>

    <p>Or these would recognize the difference between <code>*.doc</code>
    files containing Microsoft Word or FrameMaker documents. (These are
    incompatible file formats which use the same file suffix.)</p>

    <div class="example"><pre># Frame
0  string  \&lt;MakerFile        application/x-frame
0  string  \&lt;MIFFile          application/x-frame
0  string  \&lt;MakerDictionary  application/x-frame
0  string  \&lt;MakerScreenFon   application/x-frame
0  string  \&lt;MML              application/x-frame
0  string  \&lt;Book             application/x-frame
0  string  \&lt;Maker            application/x-frame

# MS-Word
0  string  \376\067\0\043            application/msword
0  string  \320\317\021\340\241\261  application/msword
0  string  \333\245-\0\0\0           application/msword</pre></div>

    <p>An optional MIME encoding can be included as a fifth column.
    For example, this can recognize gzipped files and set the
    encoding for them.</p>

    <div class="example"><pre># gzip (GNU zip, not to be confused with
#       [Info-ZIP/PKWARE] zip archiver)

0  string  \037\213  application/octet-stream  x-gzip</pre></div>

<h2><a name="performance" id="performance">Performance Issues</a></h2>
    <p>This module is not for every system. If your system is barely
    keeping up with its load or if you're performing a web server
    benchmark, you may not want to enable this because the
    processing is not free.</p>

    <p>However, an effort was made to improve the performance of
    the original <code>file(1)</code> code to make it fit in a busy web
    server. It was designed for a server where there are thousands of users
    who publish their own documents. This is probably very common
    on intranets. Many times, it's helpful if the server can make
    more intelligent decisions about a file's contents than the
    file name allows ...even if just to reduce the "why doesn't my
    page work" calls when users improperly name their own files.
    You have to decide if the extra work suits your
    environment.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>For compliance with Mr Darwin's terms: this has been very

      <ul>
        <li>all-in-one file for compilation convenience when moving from
        one version of Apache to the next.</li>

        <li>Memory allocation is done through the Apache API's pool
        structure.</li>

        <li>All functions have had necessary Apache API request or server
        structures passed to them where necessary to call other Apache API
        routines. (<em>i.e.</em>, usually for logging, files, or memory
        allocation in itself or a called function.)</li>

        <li>struct magic has been converted from an array to a single-ended
        linked list because it only grows one record at a time, it's only
        accessed sequentially, and the Apache API has no equivalent of
        <code>realloc()</code>.</li>

        <li>Functions have been changed to get their parameters from the
        server configuration instead of globals.  (It should be reentrant
        now but has not been tested in a threaded environment.)</li>

        <li>Places where it used to print results to stdout now saves them
        in a list where they're used to set the MIME type in the Apache

<h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>Content negotiation, or more accurately content selection, is
    the selection of the document that best matches the clients
    capabilities, from one of several available documents. There
    are two implementations of this.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A type map (a file with the handler
      <code>type-map</code>) which explicitly lists the files
      containing the variants.</li>

      <li>A MultiViews search (enabled by the <code>MultiViews</code>
      <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#options">Options</a></code>), where the server does
      an implicit filename pattern match, and choose from amongst the
      results.</li>

<h2><a name="typemaps" id="typemaps">Type maps</a></h2>
    <p>A type map has a format similar to RFC822 mail headers. It
    contains document descriptions separated by blank lines, with
    lines beginning with a hash character ('#') treated as
    comments. A document description consists of several header
    records; records may be continued on multiple lines if the
    continuation lines start with spaces. The leading space will be
    deleted and the lines concatenated. A header record consists of
    a keyword name, which always ends in a colon, followed by a
    value. Whitespace is allowed between the header name and value,
    and between the tokens of value. The headers allowed are: </p>

      <dd>The encoding of the file. Apache only recognizes
      encodings that are defined by an <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_mime.html#addencoding">AddEncoding</a></code> directive.
      This normally includes the encodings <code>x-compress</code>
      for compress'd files, and <code>x-gzip</code> for gzip'd
      files. The <code>x-</code> prefix is ignored for encoding
      comparisons.</dd>

      <dt><code>Content-Language:</code></dt>
      <dd>The language(s) of the variant, as an Internet standard
      language tag (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt">RFC 1766</a>). An example is <code>en</code>,
      meaning English. If the variant contains more than one
      language, they are separated by a comma.</dd>

      <dt><code>Content-Length:</code></dt>
      <dd>The length of the file, in bytes. If this header is not
      present, then the actual length of the file is used.</dd>

      <dt><code>Content-Type:</code></dt>

      <dd>
        The <a class="glossarylink" href="../glossary.html#mime-type" title="see glossary">MIME media type</a> of
        the document, with optional parameters. Parameters are
        separated from the media type and from one another by a
        semi-colon, with a syntax of <code>name=value</code>. Common
        parameters include:

        <dl>
          <dt><code>level</code></dt>
          <dd>an integer specifying the version of the media type.
          For <code>text/html</code> this defaults to 2, otherwise
          0.</dd>

          <dt><code>qs</code></dt>
          <dd>a floating-point number with a value in the range 0[.000]
          to 1[.000], indicating the relative 'quality' of this variant
          compared to the other available variants, independent of
          the client's capabilities. For example, a jpeg file is
          usually of higher source quality than an ascii file if it
          is attempting to represent a photograph. However, if the
          resource being represented is ascii art, then an ascii
          file would have a higher source quality than a jpeg file.
          All <code>qs</code> values are therefore specific to a given
          resource.</dd>

      <dt><code>URI:</code></dt>
      <dd>uri of the file containing the variant (of the given
      media type, encoded with the given content encoding). These
      are interpreted as URLs relative to the map file; they must
      be on the same server (!), and they must refer to files to
      which the client would be granted access if they were to be
      requested directly.</dd>

      <dt><code>Body:</code></dt>
      <dd>New in Apache 2.0, the actual content of the resource may
      be included in the type-map file using the Body header.  This
      header must contain a string that designates a delimiter for
      the body content. Then all following lines in the type map
      file will be considered part of the resource body until the
      delimiter string is found.

    <p>A MultiViews search is enabled by the <code>MultiViews</code>

    <code>/some/dir/foo</code> does <em>not</em> exist, then the
    server reads the directory looking for all files named
    <code>foo.*</code>, and effectively fakes up a type map which
    names all those files, assigning them the same media types and
    content-encodings it would have if the client had asked for one
    of them by name. It then chooses the best match to the client's
    requirements, and returns that document.</p>

    <p>The <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_mime.html#multiviewsmatch">MultiViewsMatch</a></code>

    <p>If set, this directive allows content-negotiated documents
    to be cached by proxy servers. This could mean that clients
    behind those proxys could retrieve versions of the documents
    that are not the best match for their abilities, but it will
    make caching more efficient.</p>

    <p>This directive only applies to requests which come from
    HTTP/1.0 browsers. HTTP/1.1 provides much better control over
    the caching of negotiated documents, and this directive has no
    effect in responses to HTTP/1.1 requests.</p>

    <p>Prior to version 2.0,

    given, and the user's <code>Accept-Language</code> header assigned

    <p>The <code class="directive">LanguagePriority</code> sets the precedence
    of language variants for the case where the client does not
    express a preference, when handling a MultiViews request. The list
    of <var>MIME-lang</var> are in order of decreasing preference.</p>

    <div class="example"><h3>Example:</h3><p><code>
      LanguagePriority en fr de
    </code></p></div>

    <p>For a request for <code>foo.html</code>, where
    <code>foo.html.fr</code> and <code>foo.html.de</code> both
    existed, but the browser did not express a language preference,
    then <code>foo.html.fr</code> would be returned.</p>

    <p>Note that this directive only has an effect if a 'best'
    language cannot be determined by any other means or the <code class="directive"><a href="#forcelanguagepriority">ForceLanguagePriority</a></code> directive
    is not <code>None</code>. In general, the client determines the
    language preference, not the server.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

    <div class="warning"><h3>Warning</h3>
      <p>Do not enable proxying with <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyrequests">ProxyRequests</a></code> until you have <a href="#access">secured your server</a>. Open proxy servers are dangerous both to your
      network and to the Internet at large.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This module implements a proxy/gateway for Apache. It implements
    proxying capability for <code>AJP13</code> (Apache JServe Protocol
    version 1.3), <code>FTP</code>, <code>CONNECT</code> (for SSL),
    <code>HTTP/0.9</code>, <code>HTTP/1.0</code>, and <code>HTTP/1.1</code>.
    The module can be configured to connect to other proxy modules for these
    and other protocols.</p>

    <p>Apache's proxy features are divided into several modules in
    addition to <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a></code>:
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_http.html">mod_proxy_http</a></code>, <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_ftp.html">mod_proxy_ftp</a></code>,
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_ajp.html">mod_proxy_ajp</a></code>, <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html">mod_proxy_balancer</a></code>,
    and <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_connect.html">mod_proxy_connect</a></code>.  Thus, if you want to use
    one or more of the particular proxy functions, load
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a></code> <em>and</em> the appropriate module(s)
    into the server (either statically at compile-time or dynamically
    via the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a></code>
    directive).</p>

    <p>In addition, extended features are provided by other modules.
    Caching is provided by <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_cache.html">mod_cache</a></code> and related
    modules.  The ability to contact remote servers using the SSL/TLS
    protocol is provided by the <code>SSLProxy*</code> directives of
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_ssl.html">mod_ssl</a></code>.  These additional modules will need
    to be loaded and configured to take advantage of these features.</p>

<h2><a name="forwardreverse" id="forwardreverse">Forward Proxies and Reverse 
       Proxies/Gateways</a></h2>
      <p>Apache can be configured in both a <dfn>forward</dfn> and
      <dfn>reverse</dfn> proxy (also known as <dfn>gateway</dfn>) mode.</p>

      <p>An ordinary <dfn>forward proxy</dfn> is an intermediate
      server that sits between the client and the <em>origin
      server</em>.  In order to get content from the origin server,
      the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server
      as the target. The proxy then requests the content from the
      origin server and returns it to the client.  The client must be
      specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other
      sites.</p>

      <p>A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet
      access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a
      firewall.  The forward proxy can also use caching (as provided
      by <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_cache.html">mod_cache</a></code>) to reduce network usage.</p>

      <p>The forward proxy is activated using the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyrequests">ProxyRequests</a></code> directive.  Because
      forward proxies allow clients to access arbitrary sites through
      your server and to hide their true origin, it is essential that
      you <a href="#access">secure your server</a> so that only
      authorized clients can access the proxy before activating a
      forward proxy.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>reverse proxy</dfn> (or <dfn>gateway</dfn>), by
      contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web
      server.  No special configuration on the client is necessary.
      The client makes ordinary requests for content in the namespace
      of the reverse proxy.  The reverse proxy then decides where to
      send those requests and returns the content as if it were itself
      the origin.</p>

      <p>A typical usage of a reverse proxy is to provide Internet
      users access to a server that is behind a firewall.  Reverse
      proxies can also be used to balance load among several back-end
      servers or to provide caching for a slower back-end server.
      In addition, reverse proxies can be used simply to bring
      several servers into the same URL space.</p>

      <p>A reverse proxy is activated using the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code> directive or the
      <code>[P]</code> flag to the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule">RewriteRule</a></code> directive.  It is
      <strong>not</strong> necessary to turn <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyrequests">ProxyRequests</a></code> on in order to
      configure a reverse proxy.</p>

<h2><a name="workers" id="workers">Workers</a></h2>
      <p>The proxy manages the configuration of origin servers and their
      communication parameters in objects called <dfn>workers</dfn>.
      There are two built-in workers: the default forward proxy worker and the
      default reverse proxy worker. Additional workers can be configured
      explicitly.</p>

      <p>The two default workers have a fixed configuration
      and will be used if no other worker matches the request.
      They do not use HTTP Keep-Alive or connection pooling.
      The TCP connections to the origin server will instead be
      opened and closed for each request.</p>

      <p>Explicitly configured workers are identified by their URL.
      They are usually created and configured using
      <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code> or
      <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypassmatch">ProxyPassMatch</a></code> when used
      for a reverse proxy:</p>

      <div class="example"><p><code>
          ProxyPass /example http://backend.example.com connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
      </code></p></div>

      <p>This will create a worker associated with the origin server URL
      <code>http://backend.example.com</code> that will use the given timeout
      values. When used in a forward proxy, workers are usually defined
      via the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyset">ProxySet</a></code> directive:</p>

      <div class="example"><p><code>
          ProxySet http://backend.example.com connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
      </code></p></div>

      <p>or alternatively using <code class="directive"><a href="#proxy">Proxy</a></code>
      and <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyset">ProxySet</a></code>:</p>

      <div class="example"><p><code>
        &lt;Proxy http://backend.example.com&gt;<br />
        <span class="indent">
          ProxySet connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
        </span>
        &lt;/Proxy&gt;
      </code></p></div>

      <p>Using explicitly configured workers in the forward mode is
      not very common, because forward proxies usually communicate with many
      different origin servers. Creating explicit workers for some of the
      origin servers can still be useful if they are used very often.
      Explicitly configured workers have no concept of forward or reverse
      proxying by themselves. They encapsulate a common concept of
      communication with origin servers. A worker created by
      <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code> for use in a
      reverse proxy will also be used for forward proxy requests whenever
      the URL to the origin server matches the worker URL, and vice versa.</p>

      <p>The URL identifying a direct worker is the URL of its
      origin server including any path components given:</p>

      <div class="example"><p><code>
          ProxyPass /examples http://backend.example.com/examples<br />
          ProxyPass /docs http://backend.example.com/docs
      </code></p></div>

      <p>This example defines two different workers, each using a separate
      connection pool and configuration.</p>

      <div class="warning"><h3>Worker Sharing</h3>
        <p>Worker sharing happens if the worker URLs overlap, which occurs when
        the URL of some worker is a leading substring of the URL of another
        worker defined later in the configuration file. In the following example</p>

        <div class="example"><p><code>
            ProxyPass /apps http://backend.example.com/ timeout=60<br />
            ProxyPass /examples http://backend.example.com/examples timeout=10
        </code></p></div>

        <p>the second worker isn't actually created. Instead the first
        worker is used. The benefit is, that there is only one connection pool,
        so connections are more often reused. Note that all configuration attributes
        given explicitly for the later worker and some configuration defaults will
        overwrite the configuration given for the first worker. This will be logged
        as a warning. In the above example, the resulting timeout value
        for the URL <code>/apps</code> will be <code>10</code> instead
        of <code>60</code>!</p>

        <p>If you want to avoid worker sharing, sort your worker definitions
        by URL length, starting with the longest worker URLs. If you want to maximize
        worker sharing, use the reverse sort order. See also the related warning about
        ordering <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code> directives.</p>

      </div> 

      <p>Explicitly configured workers come in two flavors:
      <dfn>direct workers</dfn> and <dfn>(load) balancer workers</dfn>.
      They support many important configuration attributes which are
      described below in the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code>
      directive. The same attributes can also be set using
      <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyset">ProxySet</a></code>.</p>

      <p>The set of options available for a direct worker
      depends on the protocol which is specified in the origin server URL.
      Available protocols include <code>ajp</code>,
      <code>ftp</code>, <code>http</code> and <code>scgi</code>.</p>

      <p>Balancer workers are virtual workers that use direct workers known
      as their members to actually handle the requests. Each balancer can
      have multiple members. When it handles a request, it chooses a member
      based on the configured load balancing algorithm.</p>

      <p>A balancer worker is created if its worker URL uses
      <code>balancer</code> as the protocol scheme.
      The balancer URL uniquely identifies the balancer worker.
      Members are added to a balancer using
      <code class="directive"><a href="#balancermember">BalancerMember</a></code>.</p>

<h2><a name="access" id="access">Controlling Access to Your Proxy</a></h2>
      <p>You can control who can access your proxy via the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxy">&lt;Proxy&gt;</a></code> control block as in
      the following example:</p>

      <div class="example"><p><code>
        &lt;Proxy *&gt;<br />
        <span class="indent">
          Order Deny,Allow<br />
          Deny from all<br />
          Allow from 192.168.0<br />
        </span>
        &lt;/Proxy&gt;
      </code></p></div>

      <p>For more information on access control directives, see
      <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_authz_host.html">mod_authz_host</a></code>.</p>

      <p>Strictly limiting access is essential if you are using a
      forward proxy (using the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyrequests">ProxyRequests</a></code> directive).
      Otherwise, your server can be used by any client to access
      arbitrary hosts while hiding his or her true identity.  This is
      dangerous both for your network and for the Internet at large.
      When using a reverse proxy (using the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code> directive with
      <code>ProxyRequests Off</code>), access control is less
      critical because clients can only contact the hosts that you
      have specifically configured.</p>

<h2><a name="startup" id="startup">Slow Startup</a></h2>
      <p>If you're using the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyblock">ProxyBlock</a></code> directive, hostnames' IP addresses are looked up
      and cached during startup for later match test. This may take a few
      seconds (or more) depending on the speed with which the hostname lookups
      occur.</p>

<h2><a name="intranet" id="intranet">Intranet Proxy</a></h2>
      <p>An Apache proxy server situated in an intranet needs to forward
      external requests through the company's firewall (for this, configure
      the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxyremote">ProxyRemote</a></code> directive
      to forward the respective <var>scheme</var> to the firewall proxy).
      However, when it has to
      access resources within the intranet, it can bypass the firewall when
      accessing hosts. The <code class="directive"><a href="#noproxy">NoProxy</a></code>
      directive is useful for specifying which hosts belong to the intranet and
      should be accessed directly.</p>

      <p>Users within an intranet tend to omit the local domain name from their
      WWW requests, thus requesting "http://somehost/" instead of
      <code>http://somehost.example.com/</code>. Some commercial proxy servers
      let them get away with this and simply serve the request, implying a
      configured local domain. When the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxydomain">ProxyDomain</a></code> directive is used and the server is <a href="#proxyrequests">configured for proxy service</a>, Apache can return
      a redirect response and send the client to the correct, fully qualified,
      server address. This is the preferred method since the user's bookmark
      files will then contain fully qualified hosts.</p>

<h2><a name="envsettings" id="envsettings">Protocol Adjustments</a></h2>
      <p>For circumstances where <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a></code> is sending
      requests to an origin server that doesn't properly implement
      keepalives or HTTP/1.1, there are two <a href="../env.html">environment variables</a> that can force the
      request to use HTTP/1.0 with no keepalive. These are set via the
      <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_env.html#setenv">SetEnv</a></code> directive.</p>

      <p>These are the <code>force-proxy-request-1.0</code> and

<h2><a name="request-bodies" id="request-bodies">Request Bodies</a></h2>

    <p>Some request methods such as POST include a request body.
    The HTTP protocol requires that requests which include a body
    either use chunked transfer encoding or send a
    <code>Content-Length</code> request header.  When passing these
    requests on to the origin server, <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_http.html">mod_proxy_http</a></code>
    will always attempt to send the <code>Content-Length</code>.  But
    if the body is large and the original request used chunked
    encoding, then chunked encoding may also be used in the upstream
    request.  You can control this selection using <a href="../env.html">environment variables</a>.  Setting
    <code>proxy-sendcl</code> ensures maximum compatibility with
    upstream servers by always sending the
    <code>Content-Length</code>, while setting
    <code>proxy-sendchunked</code> minimizes resource usage by using
    chunked encoding.</p>

<h2><a name="x-headers" id="x-headers">Reverse Proxy Request Headers</a></h2>

    <p>When acting in a reverse-proxy mode (using the <code class="directive"><a href="#proxypass">ProxyPass</a></code> directive, for example),
    <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_proxy_http.html">mod_proxy_http</a></code> adds several request headers in
    order to pass information to the origin server. These headers
    are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>X-Forwarded-For</code></dt>
      <dd>The IP address of the client.</dd>
      <dt><code>X-Forwarded-Host</code></dt>
      <dd>The original host requested by the client in the <code>Host</code> 
       HTTP request header.</dd>
      <dt><code>X-Forwarded-Server</code></dt>
      <dd>The hostname of the proxy server.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Be careful when using these headers on the origin server, since
    they will contain more than one (comma-separated) value if the
    original request already contained one of these headers. For
    example, you can use <code>%{X-Forwarded-For}i</code> in the log
    format string of the origin server to log the original clients IP
    address, but you may get more than one address if the request
    passes through several proxies.</p>

    <dl>
    
    <dt><var><a name="domain" id="domain">Domain</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>Domain</dfn> is a partially qualified DNS domain name, preceded
    by a period. It represents a list of hosts which logically belong to the
    same DNS domain or zone (<em>i.e.</em>, the suffixes of the hostnames are
    all ending in <var>Domain</var>).</p>

    <div class="example"><h3>Examples</h3><p><code>
      .com .apache.org.
    </code></p></div>

    <p>To distinguish <var>Domain</var>s from <var><a href="#hostname">Hostname</a></var>s (both syntactically and semantically; a DNS domain can
    have a DNS A record, too!), <var>Domain</var>s are always written with a
    leading period.</p>
    
    <div class="note"><h3>Note</h3>
      <p>Domain name comparisons are done without regard to the case, and
      <var>Domain</var>s are always assumed to be anchored in the root of the
      DNS tree; therefore, the two domains <code>.ExAmple.com</code> and
      <code>.example.com.</code> (note the trailing period) are considered
      equal. Since a domain comparison does not involve a DNS lookup, it is much
      more efficient than subnet comparison.</p>

    <dt><var><a name="subnet" id="subnet">SubNet</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>SubNet</dfn> is a partially qualified internet address in
    numeric (dotted quad) form, optionally followed by a slash and the netmask,
    specified as the number of significant bits in the <var>SubNet</var>. It is
    used to represent a subnet of hosts which can be reached over a common
    network interface. In the absence of the explicit net mask it is assumed
    that omitted (or zero valued) trailing digits specify the mask. (In this
    case, the netmask can only be multiples of 8 bits wide.) Examples:</p>

    <dl>
    <dt><code>192.168</code> or <code>192.168.0.0</code></dt>
    <dd>the subnet 192.168.0.0 with an implied netmask of 16 valid bits
    (sometimes used in the netmask form <code>255.255.0.0</code>)</dd>
    <dt><code>192.168.112.0/21</code></dt>
    <dd>the subnet <code>192.168.112.0/21</code> with a netmask of 21
    valid bits (also used in the form <code>255.255.248.0</code>)</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>As a degenerate case, a <em>SubNet</em> with 32 valid bits is the
    equivalent to an <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var>, while a <var>SubNet</var> with zero
    valid bits (<em>e.g.</em>, 0.0.0.0/0) is the same as the constant

    <dt><var><a name="ipaddr" id="ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <dfn>IPAddr</dfn> represents a fully qualified internet address in

    <p>A <dfn>Hostname</dfn> is a fully qualified DNS domain name which can
    be resolved to one or more <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddrs</a></var> via the
    DNS domain name service. It represents a logical host (in contrast to
	<var><a href="#domain">Domain</a></var>s, see above) and must be resolvable
    to at least one <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var> (or often to a list
    of hosts with different <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var>s).</p>

    <div class="note"><h3>Note</h3>
      <p>In many situations, it is more effective to specify an <var><a href="#ipaddr">IPAddr</a></var> in place of a <var>Hostname</var> since a

      deal of time when the connection to the name server uses a slow PPP
      link.</p>
      <p><var>Hostname</var> comparisons are done without regard to the case,
      and <var>Hostname</var>s are always assumed to be anchored in the root
      of the DNS tree; therefore, the two hosts <code>WWW.ExAmple.com</code>
      and <code>www.example.com.</code> (note the trailing period) are
      considered equal.</p>

      http://example.com/foo, http://example.com/foo/bar, and 
      http://example.com/foobar.  The matching of the final URL differs
      from the behavior of the <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/core.html#location">&lt;Location&gt;</a></code> section, which for purposes of this note

    <p><strong>ProxyPass <code>key=value</code> Parameters</strong></p>

    <p>In Apache HTTP Server 2.1 and later, mod_proxy supports pooled
    connections to a backend server.  Connections created on demand
    can be retained in a pool for future use.  Limits on the pool size
    and other settings can be coded on
    the <code class="directive">ProxyPass</code> directive
    using  <code>key=value</code> parameters, described in the tables
    below.</p>

    <p>By default, mod_proxy will allow and retain the maximum number of
    connections that could be used simultaneously by that web server child
    process.  Use the <code>max</code> parameter to reduce the number from
    the default.  Use the <code>ttl</code> parameter to set an optional
    time to live; connections which have been unused for at least
    <code>ttl</code> seconds will be closed.  <code>ttl</code> can be used
    to avoid using a connection which is subject to closing because of the
    backend server's keep-alive timeout.</p>

    <p>The pool of connections is maintained per web server child
    process, and <code>max</code> and other settings are not coordinated 
    among all child processes, except when only one child process is allowed
    by configuration or MPM design.</p>

    This helps in various situations where a firewall between Apache and
    the backend server (regardless of protocol) tends to silently
    drop connections or when backends themselves may be under round-
